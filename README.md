# ClimateCrafters #12 – GenHack'25

**Systematic bias in urban satellite products: urban origin and operational correction**

## Key Results
- ERA5-Land underestimates the real UHI by **0.68 °C** on average (max 1.23 °C in Nice)
- Error **directly linked to urbanization level** (r = -0.64, p < 10⁻¹⁰)
- Random Forest model + NDVI + 5 variables → **MAE = 0.29 °C** → **-57% error** vs ERA5-Land
- Full explainability with SHAP

## Repository Content
- `week4_team12.ipynb` : complete and commented notebook
- `figures/` : all key visualizations
- `data/` : structure (data too large for GitHub, but everything is reproducible)


Thanks to the organizers and the jury!
